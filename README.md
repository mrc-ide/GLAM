# GLAM

Malaria infections often harbor multiple parasite haplotypes that appear and disappear over time.  When you sequence longitudinal samples, true infections can be masked both by within‑host clearance and by the limited sensitivity of your assay.  GLAM uses a probabilistic model of haplotype dynamics and detection to reconstruct, for each individual, the most likely infection start times and durations from longitudinal haplotype presence/absence data.
